Hello! <br/>

I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working with <a target="_blank" href="pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/"> Prof. Somesh Jha</a>. I graduated from IIIT-Delhi in 2017 with a Bachelors in Computer Science where I collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="http://vinayaknaik.info/">Prof. Vinayak Naik</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niu.edu/ceet/about/faculty-and-instructors/butail-sachit.shtml">Prof. Sachit Butail</a>.

Previously, I spent time at Microsoft Research as a Research Fellow closely collaborating with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/">Kapil Vaswani</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/">Confidential Computing Group</a>. I also collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aseemr/">Aseem Rastogi</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/svolos/">Stavros Volos</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/apmehra/">Apurv Mehra</a>. Prior to this, I was working as a DevSecOps Engineer at <a target="_blank"  href="https://grab.com">Grab</a> to automate their security defenses and as a Site Reliability Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://media.net">media.net</a> to support their near-unethical advertising business. Phew.



Pronunciation: Nam-an Goo-ptaa. First name rhymes with "summon".

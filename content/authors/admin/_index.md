Hello! I am a Computer Science PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> collaborating with the <a target="_blank" href="https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/">MadS&P Security & Privacy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://gws.wisc.edu/staff/walsh-kate/">Preventing Interpersonal Violence and Overcoming Trauma (PIVOT)</a> lab. I am advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/">Prof. Rahul Chatterjee</a> and closely collaborate with <a target="_blank" href="https://gws.wisc.edu/staff/walsh-kate/">Prof. Kate Walsh</a>.

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of computer security, privacy, sociology and psychology from a feminist and trauma-informed perspective. Specifically, I work on critiquing and designing safe and usable technological interventions for the at-risk populations like the survivors of Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence. Further, I care about reclaiming agency, privacy and anonymity from the hands of our corporate overlords.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/">Kapil Vaswani</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/apurvmehra?lang=en">Apurv Mehra</a> where I closely collaborated with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/">Confidential Computing</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/publications/">Technology for Empowerment / Emerging Markets (TEM)</a> group. I worked on implementing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/tao"> formally verified boot protocol</a>, hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and developing an offline streaming platform for marginazlied low-income populations in remote Indian villages. 

I graduated from IIIT-Delhi in 2017 with a Bachelors in Computer Science where I collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="http://vinayaknaik.info/">Prof. Vinayak Naik</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niu.edu/ceet/about/faculty-and-instructors/butail-sachit.shtml">Prof. Sachit Butail</a>.

<!-- 
Prior to this, I was working as a DevSecOps Engineer at <a target="_blank"  href="https://grab.com">Grab</a> to automate their security defenses and as a Site Reliability Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://media.net">media.net</a> to support their near-unethical contextual advertising business. Phew.  -->

Pronunciation: Na-man. First name rhymes with "summon".

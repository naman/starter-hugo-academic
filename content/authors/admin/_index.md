Hello! <br/>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" href="https://wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> collaborating with the <a target="_blank" href="https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/">MadS&P Security & Privacy group</a>. I am advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/">Prof. Rahul Chatterjee</a>. My primary research interests lie in the intersection of systems security, privacy and sociology & psychology. Specifically I build secure, private and usable systems for the at-risk populations like the survivors of Intimate Partner Violence, non-western populations, incarcerated and victims of Sex Traficking. I care about reclaiming digital privacy and anonymity from the hands of our corporate overlords.

Previously, I spent time at Microsoft Research as a Research Fellow closely collaborating with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/">Kapil Vaswani</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/">Confidential Computing Group</a> where I worked on implementing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/tao"> formally verified boot protocol</a> and hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). 

I graduated from IIIT-Delhi in 2017 with a Bachelors in Computer Science where I collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="http://vinayaknaik.info/">Prof. Vinayak Naik</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niu.edu/ceet/about/faculty-and-instructors/butail-sachit.shtml">Prof. Sachit Butail</a>.

<!-- 
Prior to this, I was working as a DevSecOps Engineer at <a target="_blank"  href="https://grab.com">Grab</a> to automate their security defenses and as a Site Reliability Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://media.net">media.net</a> to support their near-unethical contextual advertising business. Phew.  -->

Pronunciation: Na-man. First name rhymes with "summon".

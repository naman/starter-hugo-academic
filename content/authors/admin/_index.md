Hello! I am Naman (he/him), a Computer Science PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/">MadS&P Security & Privacy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://crgw.gws.wisc.edu/sexual-violence-research-initiative/">Sexual Violence Research Initiative (SVRI)</a> groups. With advise from <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/">Prof. Rahul Chatterjee</a>, I critically examine digital safety through inter-disciplinary lenses in sociology such as feminism, rurality, and decoloniality. Specifically, I analyze the barriers faced by the marginalized communities facing gender-based violence when they interface with technology, and design interventions to support them. Further, I coordinate the <a target="_blank" href="https://techclinic.cs.wisc.edu/">Madison Tech Clinic</a> to support survivors of IPV with their technical concerns.

Prior to PhD, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research (MSR), advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/">Kapil Vaswani</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/">Confidential Computing</a> group) and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/apurvmehra?lang=en">Apurv Mehra</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/technology-and-empowerment/publications/">Technology for Empowerment</a> or Emerging Markets (TEM)) groups.
At MSR, I worked on a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/tao">formally verified boot protocol</a>, a hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/blendnet/">offline streaming platform</a> for low-income and people with a reduced tech literacy in rural India.

I graduated from IIIT-Delhi with a Bachelors in Computer Science where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="http://vinayaknaik.info/">Prof. Vinayak Naik</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niu.edu/ceet/about/faculty-and-instructors/butail-sachit.shtml">Prof. Sachit Butail</a>.

<!--
Prior to this, I was working as a DevSecOps Engineer at <a target="_blank"  href="https://grab.com">Grab</a> to automate their security defenses and as a Site Reliability Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://media.net">media.net</a> to support their near-unethical contextual advertising business. Phew.  -->

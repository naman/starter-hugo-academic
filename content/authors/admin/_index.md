Hello! <br/>

I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison collaborating with the <a target="_blank" href="https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/"> MadS&P</a>. I graduated from IIIT-Delhi in 2017 with a Bachelors in Computer Science where I collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="http://vinayaknaik.info/">Prof. Vinayak Naik</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niu.edu/ceet/about/faculty-and-instructors/butail-sachit.shtml">Prof. Sachit Butail</a>.

Previously, I spent time at Microsoft Research as a Research Fellow closely collaborating with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kapilv/">Kapil Vaswani</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/confidential-computing/">Confidential Computing Group</a>. 
<!-- I also collaborated with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/aseemr/">Aseem Rastogi</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/svolos/">Stavros Volos</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/apmehra/">Apurv Mehra</a>. -->
Prior to this, I was working as a DevSecOps Engineer at <a target="_blank"  href="https://grab.com">Grab</a> to automate their security defenses and as a Site Reliability Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://media.net">media.net</a> to support their near-unethical contextual advertising business. Phew. 

My primary research interests lie in building secure, private and usable systems for the at-risk population. I also care about reclaiming digital privacy and anonymity from the hands of our corporate overlords.

Pronunciation: Na-man. First name rhymes with "summon".

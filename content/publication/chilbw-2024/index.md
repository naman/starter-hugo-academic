abstract: 'The ubiquitous use of technology by college students makes them
vulnerable to harassment, harm, and intimidation via technological
means. We evaluate the prevalence of such technology-facilitated
abuse (TFA) among college students in the USA using a critical,
feminist, and trauma-informed lens, which is essential to inform
policymakers and advocates who support students. We surveyed
776 college students in a large R1 university located in the Midwest
region of the USA to examine the prevalence of TFA faced by stu-
dents marginalized by socio-economic factors, the support sought
by student survivors, and the efficacy of support structures. Our
findings indicate that 70% students experience TFA, but more than
half of them do not seek support. Among the survivors who seek
support, 93% students solely rely on informal resources like friends
and family, and 6% solely seek support from formal networks such
as survivor services or law enforcement. Therefore, we call on
policymakers to direct attention to TFA, create tailored interven-
tions to support marginalized students and propose campus-wide
campaigns to spread awareness among college students.'
